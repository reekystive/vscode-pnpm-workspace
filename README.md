# pnpm Workspace

A comprehensive VS Code extension providing productivity tools for pnpm workspace projects. This extension aims to streamline your monorepo development workflow with a suite of workspace-specific utilities.

## ðŸš€ Current Features

**Copy Workspace Dependencies** - The first of many workspace productivity tools!

- **Copy Workspace Dependencies**: Select any package in your pnpm workspace and copy its workspace dependencies to clipboard, with each dependency on a new line
- **Re-scan Workspace**: Manually refresh the workspace package cache when needed
- **Web Extension Support**: Works in VS Code for the Web and remote development environments
- **Workspace Root Support**: Includes the workspace root package with special marking

## ðŸ”® Planned Features

More productivity tools are coming soon! Future releases will include:

- Package dependency visualization
- Workspace navigation shortcuts  
- Build script management across packages
- Inter-package dependency analysis
- And many more workspace utilities...

## Commands

This extension contributes the following commands:

- `pnpm Workspace: Copy Workspace Dependencies Of...` - Opens a quick picker to select a package and copies its workspace dependencies
- `pnpm Workspace: Re-scan Workspace Packages` - Clears the package cache and re-scans the workspace

## Usage

1. Open a pnpm workspace (a project with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
2. Run `pnpm Workspace: Copy Workspace Dependencies Of...` from the Command Palette
3. Select the package you want to get dependencies for
4. The workspace dependencies will be copied to your clipboard, separated by newlines

The extension automatically scans your workspace on first use and caches the results. Use the re-scan command if you've added or removed packages.

## Configuration

You can customize which types of dependencies to include when copying workspace dependencies:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `pnpmWorkspace.copyWorkspaceDependencies.includeDependencies` | `true` | Include production dependencies |
| `pnpmWorkspace.copyWorkspaceDependencies.includeDevDependencies` | `true` | Include development dependencies |
| `pnpmWorkspace.copyWorkspaceDependencies.includeOptionalDependencies` | `true` | Include optional dependencies |

To configure these settings:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, / Cmd+,)
2. Search for "pnpm Workspace"
3. Toggle the checkboxes for the dependency types you want to include

## Requirements

- A valid `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file in your workspace root
- VS Code 1.99.0 or higher

## How it Works

The extension:

1. Looks for `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in your workspace
2. Discovers all packages based on the workspace patterns
3. Parses each `package.json` to find workspace dependencies (dependencies starting with `workspace:`)
4. Provides a quick picker interface to select and copy dependencies

## Platform Support

This extension is platform-agnostic and works in:

- VS Code Desktop
- VS Code for the Web
- Remote development environments
- Virtual workspaces
