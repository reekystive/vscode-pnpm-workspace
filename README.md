## Commands

This extension contributes the following commands:

- `pnpm Workspace: Copy Workspace Dependency Names Of...` - Opens a quick picker to select a package and copies its workspace dependency names
- `pnpm Workspace: Copy Workspace Dependency Paths Of...` - Opens a quick picker to select a package and copies its workspace dependency paths
- `pnpm Workspace: Search in Package and Workspace Dependencies...` - Opens a quick picker to select a package and opens search with the package and its dependencies
- `pnpm Workspace: Re-scan Workspace Packages` - Clears the package cache and re-scans the workspace

## Usage

### Copy Workspace Dependency Names

1. Open a pnpm workspace (a project with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
2. Run `pnpm Workspace: Copy Workspace Dependency Names Of...` from the Command Palette
3. Select the package you want to get dependencies for
4. The workspace dependency names will be copied to your clipboard, separated by newlines

### Copy Workspace Dependency Paths

1. Open a pnpm workspace (a project with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
2. Run `pnpm Workspace: Copy Workspace Dependency Paths Of...` from the Command Palette
3. Select the package you want to get dependency paths for
4. The workspace dependency paths will be copied to your clipboard, separated by newlines

### Search in Package and Workspace Dependencies

1. Open a pnpm workspace (a project with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
2. Run `pnpm Workspace: Search in Package and Workspace Dependencies...` from the Command Palette
3. Select the package you want to search in along with its dependencies
4. VS Code's search panel will open with the package and its workspace dependencies pre-filled in the "files to include" field
5. Enter your search term and the search will be scoped to only those packages

The extension automatically scans your workspace on first use and caches the results. Use the re-scan command if you've added or removed packages.

## Configuration

You can customize which types of dependencies to include when copying workspace dependencies:

| Setting                                                               | Default | Description                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `pnpmWorkspace.copyWorkspaceDependencies.includeDependencies`         | `true`  | Include production dependencies  |
| `pnpmWorkspace.copyWorkspaceDependencies.includeDevDependencies`      | `true`  | Include development dependencies |
| `pnpmWorkspace.copyWorkspaceDependencies.includeOptionalDependencies` | `true`  | Include optional dependencies    |

To configure these settings:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, / Cmd+,)
2. Search for "pnpm Workspace"
3. Toggle the checkboxes for the dependency types you want to include

## Requirements

- A valid `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file in your workspace root
- VS Code 1.99.0 or higher

## How it Works

The extension:

1. Looks for `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in your workspace
2. Discovers all packages based on the workspace patterns
3. Parses each `package.json` to find workspace dependencies (dependencies starting with `workspace:`)
4. Provides a quick picker interface to select and copy dependencies

## Platform Support

This extension is platform-agnostic and works in:

- VS Code Desktop
- VS Code for the Web
- Remote development environments
- Virtual workspaces
